_simplify the modernization of your legacy project by combining a minifier capable of handling both ES6 import/export syntax and outdated script-style global-variable based code._

Are you managing a legacy project that needs gradual modernization? Finding a bundler/minifier that handles **antiquated script-style global-variable based code** as well as **contemporary ES6 import/export syntax and `node_modules/` dependencies** can be challenging. With sitting-duck, you don't have to pause your project's evolution to address these issues.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a file named `minify.mjs`:**

   ```js
   import minify from "sitting-duck";

   // You can either pass a string that will be interpreted as a glob pattern by globby or an array of files.
   minify(
     `_test/*.js, !node_modules/, !**/*.min.js`, // Your JS files
     `_test/*.css, !node_modules/, !**/*.min.css`, // Your CSS files
   );
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

   ```shell-session
   npm i -D sitting-duck
   ```

3. **Update your `package.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "node ./minify.mjs --dev",
       "build": "node ./minify.mjs"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Execute the commands:**

   ```shell-session
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Optionally, update your `.gitignore`:**

   ```text
   *.min.js
   *.min.js.map
   *.min.css
   *.min.css.map
   *.LEGAL.txt
   ```

## Using Import/Exports with the `// @MODULE` Annotation

When importing a module from `node_modules/`, add the following line at the very beginning of the file:

```js
// @MODULE
```

_See the [\_test/module.js](_test/module.js) file for an example:_

```js
// @MODULE
import distance from "@turf/distance";
import { point } from "@turf/helpers";

const testModule = () => {
  const from = point([-75.343, 39.984]);
  const to = point([-75.534, 39.123]);
  const options = { units: "miles" };

  return distance(from, to, options);
};

export { testModule };
```

_CSS files are also bundled and minified using esbuild, supporting syntax like:_

```css
@import "./partial.css";
```

_For more information, consult the esbuild docs: [esbuild CSS Content Types](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css)_

## About This Project

The goals of this project are simple:

1. Minify legacy files without breaking the code.
2. Bundle and minify modern syntax.
3. Streamline your codebase's modernization.

We adhere to the principle of **"do not f\*cking touch my code"**. We understand that sometimes things just work, and we respect that. This project won't impose arbitrary coding styles, conventions, or syntax changes. When dealing with large codebases, you donâ€™t want unexpected transformations breaking your app.

To achieve this, we use:

1. [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to minify legacy files. SWC is known for its speed.
2. [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to bundle dependencies and transform modern syntax to `iife`. esbuild is also fast.

The generated files are saved alongside the original ones and can be used in place of the originals.
